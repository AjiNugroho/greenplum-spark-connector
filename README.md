# Getting started with Greenplum and Apache Spark in minutes
This page provides how to get started with Greenplum and Apache Spark. You can use these examples to apply these use cases.

# Greenplum - Spark Architecture:


# Use Cases:

1. [Read data from Greenplum table into Spark DataFrame](usecase1/README.MD)
2. [Write data from Spark DataFrame into Greenplum table](usecase1/README.MD)


# Reference
## Pivotal Greenplum
The Pivotal Greenplum Database (GPDB) is an advanced, fully featured, open source data warehouse. It provides powerful and rapid analytics on petabyte scale data volumes. Uniquely geared toward big data analytics, Greenplum Database is powered by the worldâ€™s most advanced cost-based query optimizer delivering high analytical query performance on large data volumes.

## Pivotal Greenplum-Spark Connector
The [Pivotal Greenplum-Spark Connector](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/latest/index.html) provides high speed, parallel data transfer between Greenplum Database and Apache Spark clusters to support:

- [Interactive data analysis](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/latest/overview.html)
- [In-memory analytics processing](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/latest/overview.html)
- [Batch ETL](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/latest/overview.html)

## Apache Spark
Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
