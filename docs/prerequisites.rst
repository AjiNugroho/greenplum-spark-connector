What you need to know 
=====================

The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with the commandline prompt in a
terminal.

You'll need to know basic knowledge about Greenplum and Spark.

Software 
========

The tutorial assumes that you're using a Unix-like system and docker

If your system already has Docker and Docker-compose running that you've
installed, you probably already have what you need and know what you need to
know. All the same:

Docker-Compose
--------------

You'll need a reasonably up-to-date version of Docker-compose installed on your
machine.  1.14.0 or newer should be fine.

Greenplum-Spark connector
-------------------------

Please download the Greenplum-Spark connector jar from Pivotal Network
